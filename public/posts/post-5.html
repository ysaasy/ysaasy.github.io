    <p>i'm back to working at my office.</p>
<p>my friend treated me chicken noodles for lunch, while her friend was lore-dropping her family origin and how her family came from a minority-indigenous tribe in northern borneo. yes, it was a minority and that's also why her family was trying to not identify themself as the community, due its past history with another tribe. of course the community is superstitious and has a goddess represented by the nature, or the river, as she mentioned. she's now hyperfixating on learning her heritage language, with a mission to speak it with her grand-aunt (i don't remember the part where she told us she's alive).</p>
<p>anyways, i'm rooting for her!</p>
