i think i need to automate the obsidian-11ty-github/neocities workflow cuz i'm getting lazy.
### today
* nothing
### next time
* automate the stuff so i can just open obsidian to write stuff and everything
* and only open vscodium when i want to update css or widgets
* edit favicon

also i've been interested in growing a digital garden. i first encountered it in iamrobin's very beautiful [garden](https://www.iamrob.in/garden).

okay i just opened his page again and found out about [literalclub](literal.club). the one i'm using now is [storygraph](https://thestorygraph.com) and as much as i love it, it doesn't let us make a widget for website (at least as of now). so i've been looking for something like it, but i don't want goodreads since it's a bit clunky for me.

also, back to iamrobin's [page](https://www.iamrob.in)... it's not only so pretty but also interesting: with the postcards, bookmarks, and everything. okay maybe i'm gonna make his page my #1 source of inspiration.
