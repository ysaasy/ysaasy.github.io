finally continued my thesis this whole afternoon. also told my thesis supervisor i'm gonna meet him on monday.

### today
1. creating a storygraph widget for current reading on [home](/index.html) and 5 recently-read books on [media](/media.html)
2. oh! yeah. creating a new sub-page [media](/media.html) for: recently listened song from [last.fm](https://www.last.fm), recently read books from [storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com), and recently watched films/series from [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com)
3. and also clearing stuff up from the [home](/index.html), so it's not cluttered
4. updating favicon.ico to the [orchid](https://files.catbox.moe/xdtbxt.ico) >__<

### next time
1. i think building a digital garden framework is an urgent matter, since i can't keep on writing everything in this format here. also i want to keep track of cool stuff and resources i found.

### resources
* storygraph api for the widget: [ym496/storygraph-api](https://github.com/ym496/storygraph-api/tree/main)

### what i found
* [Emma Goto](https://www.emgoto.com): very cute and clean and interesting personal page for inspiration; discovered her from this [post](https://www.emgoto.com/obsidian-digital-garden/) on obsidian digital garden
* [The "Cheap" Web](https://potato.cheap): The "cheap" web is a solarpunk philosophy of web design.
* [Westley Winks](https://wwinks.com): also a very cool personal page
* [PIRACYKILLS](https://herman.bearblog.dev/piracy-kills/): this blog post by, apparently, the creator of a very popular sketching tool [JustSketchMe](https://justsketch.me/) that i'm familiar with. very very random
