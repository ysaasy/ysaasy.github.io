running on 5 hrs sleep (3 days in a row) and continuing building this page while abandoning my thesis.

life is fun!

also i'm now learning to use [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) to create .html files from .md (+ templates for header & footer). very convenient! i only need to edit the .md files containing the metadata and the body text.

i'm planning to integrate this with [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) and iCloud Drive. so i can edit and write on my iPhone.

tutorials i'm using:
* [Midnight Reading: 🖥️ Migrating to Eleventy](https://renkotsuban.neocities.org/posts/2023-11-15-Migrating-to-Eleventy#set-up-your-posts-directory-and-post-njk)
* [PetraPixel: 11ty (eleventy) Tutorial](https://petrapixel.neocities.org/coding/eleventy-tutorial#templates)
* [nycki93/eleventy-for-neocities-users](https://github.com/nycki93/eleventy-for-neocities-users)

code editor i'm using:
