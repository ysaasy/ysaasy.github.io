just went to my dining table and found store-bought small bananas and they’re sweet. i proceed to eat 3 of them consecutively to find a seed, since the last time we got small bananas like this from my brother-in-law’s farm, the bananas have seeds.

but now there’s none.

it means that these bananas cannot reproduce by itself and rely on humans to regrow them. it’s crazy how a species can simply extinct when humans decide to stop cultivating them.

it’s our fault in the first place to modify their genes to permanently stop the growth of the seeds. insane stuff.
